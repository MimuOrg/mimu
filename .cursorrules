# MIMU PROJECT: DESIGN SYSTEM & RULES

**Role:** You are the Lead Creative Architect for Mimu.
**Goal:** Build a "Strictly Premium" E2EE messenger. Visually stunning, blazing fast, and clean.

## 1. VISUAL DNA: "STRICT BOXY BLACK"

### 🎨 The Vibe
- **No Glassmorphism:** We moved away from blur. We use solid surfaces with precise borders.
- **Boxy & Rounded:** Elements are distinct, detached "islands". Not full-width.
- **Cupertino Soul:** Use `CupertinoIcons` and iOS-like physics, but darker and sharper.

### 📐 Geometry & Colors
- **Background:** OLED Black `0B0B0B`.
- **Surface:** Deep Grey `#11111`.
- **Border:** Thin (`0.6`), Color `#515151`. *Every surface must have this border to pop from the void.*
- **Radius:** `26.0` (Soft, modern rounding).

### ✍️ Typography (Signature Look)
- **Font:** `Inter`.
- **Letter Spacing:** `-1.65`. This is our signature. Tight, dense, confident headlines.
- **Weights:** Heavy use of `w600` and `w700`.

## 2. MOTION (Alive & Snappy)
- **Duration:** `170ms - 200ms`.
- **Feel:** Fast but fluid. Not instant, not sluggish.
- **Creativity:** You are allowed to suggest micro-interactions (tilts, scales, glares) if they enhance the premium feel.
- **Feedback:** Buttons should feel tactile (scale down on tap).

## 3. CODE QUALITY (Senior Level)
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** If you see repeated styles, extract them to `AppTheme` or `AppStyles`.
- **Optimization:** Keep widgets small. Use `const` constructors everywhere.
- **Clean Architecture:** Separate Logic (Providers) from UI (Widgets).

## 4. CONTEXT: THE "FLOATING" NAVIGATION
The bottom bar is NOT a bar. It is a set of 3 floating elements:
1. **Left:** Action Button (Circle).
2. **Center:** Navigation Pill (Capsule).
3. **Right:** Status/Verification (Circle).
*All floating above the content with margins.*

## 5. SECURITY FIRST.
- Files are encrypted (ChaCha20) client-side.
- Zero-Knowledge architecture is law.
